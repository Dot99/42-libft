## Disclaimer:
This project's source code adheres to the standards of 42 School and its norms and rigorous coding practices:
```
- We refrain from using 'for,' 'do while,' 'switch,' 'case,' or 'goto' constructs.
- Each function has no more than 25 lines of code. 
- There's a maximum of 5 functions per file.
- Assignments and declarations are kept on separate lines unless the variable is declared as static.
- We ensure that no single function has more than 5 variables, promoting code simplicity and readability.
```
